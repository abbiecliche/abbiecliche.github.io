[OpenMP](https://www.openmp.org/resources/) (Open Multi-Processing) is an API that is widely used for parallel programming on [shared-memory machines](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/computer-science/shared-memory-multiprocessor#:~:text=A%20shared%2Dmemory%20multiprocessor%20is,has%20created%20or%20will%20use.).
I was exposed to OpenMP for the first time during my master's degree in an advanced operating systems course and again in high performance computing. I used OpenMP to implement [synchronization barriers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barrier_(computer_science)) in advanced operating systems and to perform parallel [list ranking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_ranking#:~:text=In%20parallel%20algorithms%2C%20the%20list,assigned%20the%20number%202%2C%20etc.) in high performance computing.
