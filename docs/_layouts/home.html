<p>
  I am an engineer, part-time master's student, and aspiring computational archeologist.
</p>

<p>
  I got my B.S. in Computer Engineering from Georgia Tech in 2021. Since then, I have been persuing an M.S. 
  in Computer Science and living in New York City.

<h3 class="archive__subtitle"> Professional History </h3>

<p>
  My undergraduate journey was non-linear, and I went through a few majors before finding Computer Engineering. My internships 
  gave me opportunities to do a broad spectrum of neat things like schedule
   flights at <a href="https://www.delta.com/us/en/about-delta/overview">Delta Air Lines</a>, 
   combat email phishing at <a href="https://fraudmarc.com/about-us">Fraudmarc</a>, 
   and research novel FPGA overlay architectures at 
   <a href="https://gtri.gatech.edu/laboratories/cybersecurity-information-protection-and-hardware-evaluation-research">GTRI</a>.
</p>

<p>
  After graduation, I took a return offer to work for <a href="https://www.l3harris.com/">L3Harris</a>, 
  where I wrote embedded DSP software for tactical radios.
</p>

<p>
  Currently, I work as an RTL engineer. I build IP for SoC network security solutions.
