Following along with the Xilinx XSI documentation and experimenting on a blinky project, I have developed a step-by-step guide for writing testbenches in C using the XSI.

I think that the [Xilinx documentation](https://docs.xilinx.com/r/en-US/ug900-vivado-logic-simulation/Using-Xilinx-Simulator-Interface) for XSI is a little sparse, so I hope that this guide helps fill in the gaps. I am using Xilinx 2022.2.
